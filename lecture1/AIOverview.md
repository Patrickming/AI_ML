## 1、what is artificial intelligence

Wiki: the ability of a system to correctly interpret external data, learn from this data, and adaptively use learned knowledge to achieve specific goals and tasks (Perceiving , Synthesizing , Inferring Information).A technology that uses computers to solve problems or make automated decisions, often for tasks that require intelligence:

- visual perception

- Speech Recognition

- decision making

 

strong artificial intelligence:

- For any intelligent task, the computer's ability to understand or learn reaches or near human level
- Computers engage in abstract reasoning and thinking
- Currently we are not able to implement Strong AI

 

 weak AI:

- Computers solve problems by detecting and learning useful patterns
- Solve a specific problem or reasoning task
- Currently used to automate a large number of processes
- It is the dominant model of artificial intelligence today



## 2、Problems solved by artificial intelligence

think like a human being( thinking humanly ) ->think rationally( thinking rationally )

Act like a human being( acting humanly ) -> act rationally( acting rationally )

Rationality: ideal concept of intelligence

### Act like a human being

#### 1.Problems intended to be solved:

1. Can machines act as intelligently as humans ?

#### 2.Turing test:

1. A series of operations that test whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior
2. It was proposed in 1950 and predicted the major theories of artificial intelligence for the next 60 years
3.  It is predicted that by the year 2000, a machine will be built that can fool 30% of adults in a five-minute question and answer session

The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, defining the machine Smart concept.

The steps are divided into：

1.Humanity: 

- Keyboard input issues 
- Receive answers from screen

2.computer/human: 

- Handle questions
- return answer 

3.judge: 

- Computer or Human ?

#### 3.Limitations:

1. Not reproducible and not suitable for mathematical analysis



### Act rationally

#### 1.Problems intended to be solved

1. do the right thing
2. Given the available information, it is expected to maximize the achievement of the goal

####  2.Rational agent（智能体）

1. An agent is a software or hardware entity that senses and acts
2. The agent is a function from perceiving historical information to action
3. For any given type of environment and task, we look for the agent (or class of agents ) with the best performance（最佳性能）

### think like a human being

#### 1.Problems intended to be solved

1. Scientific theory of the inner workings of the brain

#### 2.How to verify?

1. Predicting and testing the behavior of human subjects(人类受试者)
   1. cognitive science
2. Direct identification from neural system data
   1. Neuroscience
3. Both of the above are different from artificial intelligence
   1. Existing theories cannot explain how to achieve human general intelligence

### think rationally

#### 1.Problems intended to be solved

1. Correct argument（论证） / thought process

#### 2. Current problems

1. What is the purpose of thinking
2. Of all the thoughts I could have , what thought should I choose ?

#### 3. Connecting mathematics and philosophy directly to modern artificial intelligence

1. There are almost no widely accepted conclusions
2. Modern Scientific Beliefs: Cause and Effect（因果关系）



## 3、Artificial intelligence development timeline

### 1.The birth of artificial intelligence (1943-1956)

#### cybernetics

#### Early neural networks

The first neural network machine — SNARC

- Stochastic Neural Simulation Reinforcement Calculator: rat - in - a - maze Neural Network Simulator
- he first connectionist neural network learning machine, designed to be " rewarded " in favor of recently used paths
- 40 neurons form a randomly connected network, each neuron is implemented by a vacuum tube

#### Dartmouth 

This conference marks the birth of artificial intelligence

The definition of artificial intelligence gave birth to the artificial intelligence revolution

The meeting advocated : " Every aspect of learning or any other characteristic of intelligence should be accurately described so that machines can simulate it . "20New Jersey Institute of Technology



### 2.golden age (1956-1974)

#### search-based reasoning

- Use brute force search solution :
  - stuck in dead end
  -  Backtrace
- Defects - When the problem becomes complex, the parameters explode exponentially
- Solution : Heuristics that narrow the search by removing detours that are unlikely to lead to the correct answer

#### Natural Language Processing 

![image-20231115143915019](D:\sl\projects\AIandML\AI_ML\lecture1\assets\image-20231115143915019.png)

- Limitations: Ambiguity and uncertainty in real-world environments
- Latest trends : Statistical natural language processing , combined with automatic machine learning to obtain language knowledge

#### Microworld

Microworlds: Minsky created the concept of blocks world to simplify the real world

- Example : Smooth planes and perfect rigid bodies in physics

The concept of Microworld lays the foundation for the subsequent development of computer vision
